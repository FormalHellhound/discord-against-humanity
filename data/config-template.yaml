  - ðŸ—³ **__How to Play__**
  -
  - ðŸ›  **Game Setup**
  - 1. The first step is to invite your friends to this game using
  - '`dah.invite @user` in any channel to invite them to your fresh new game.'
  - '*You can currently have up to 10 awesome people per game.*'
  -
  - "2. Add expansions to your game! Use `dah.expansions` to see what's available"
  - and use `dah.add name_of_expansion` to add it to your game.
  - '*(Protip: want all of the cards? Use `dah.add all`!)*'
  - Remove expansions with.. you guessed it! `dah.remove`
  -
  - 3. Ready to play? Run `dah.start` and let's get started!
  - The game will continue until the maximum points are reached.
  - Configure the maximum points for your game with `dah.max_points (number)`!
  -
  - ðŸ™‡ **As a player..**
  - 1. Each round, I will direct-message you your cards.
  -
  - 2. Reply in our DM with `pick (a number)` to pick a card that you think fits the question best!
  - If a question has multiple answers, say `pick (number)` multiple times in the order you want
  - your cards to appear!
  -
  - 3. Wait for the Czar to pick the winning card
  -
  - ðŸ‘‘ **As the Czar..**
  - 1. Wait for other players to submit their choices.
  - I'll let you know when we've got all the cards we need!
  -
  - 2. Pick the card you think should win by saying `pick (a number)` in this channel!
  -
  - ðŸ”° **Need help? Questions? Problems?**
